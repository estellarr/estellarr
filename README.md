- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @estellarr. A computer science student at Bicol University College of Science. Leveling myself as a programmer, I would say I'm just an average
  programmer which has a strong foundation in JAVA, PHP, Oracle, and HTML/Css with also a quite knowledge about C/C++, Laravel, Vue, and Flutter. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Developing & UI/UX since that was my first project when I was in my senior high school years. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about what's computer science is all about.
